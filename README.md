# exercisePlan
This program displays options for a weekly exercise plan with minimal recovery issues. It keeps track of which exercise sessions fatigue your lower body, upper body, and/or lower back.
To add your own exercise sessions, edit the liftPlan[] array.
To track fatigue in a different way, edit the Session struct definition and the compatible() function definition.
